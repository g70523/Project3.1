<p>I chose to do fairies this week to do something different and less logical and more fun. The story is about two groups of fairies, naughty fairies and good fairies.
The two fairy groups are fighting each other because the naughty fairies are trying to take over the good fairies and make them all naughty. The naughty fairies convert the lead good fairy but the rest of them fight to stay good. </p>
